# A-star-algorithm-finding-path
A simple implementation of A* algorithm for finding path. A* is an algorithm that can be regarded as a combination of BFS and Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm. It not only tries to find all the paths, but also consider the cost of a path in the meantime. Which can reduce the operation time.
